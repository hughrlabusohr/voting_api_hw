## Description:

This is to be a Ruby on Rails application that serves up an API for a theoretical voting system.
## How To Use it:

The app is only partially complete, and will be finished as part 2 of the homework assignment.

However, it currently possesses some functionality that can be accessed by a user by navigating to  (http://localhost:3000/candidates/index)
which will serve up a json-formatted list of the Candidates and some pertinent information.

Additionally, if the user navigates to
 (http://localhost:3000/candidates/show?) and append id=x where x is a number 1-6. The browser will present json-formatted data for the corresponding candidate.
