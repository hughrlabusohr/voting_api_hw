Ran tests via bin/rake test and began my tdd in earnest. Right now I have 2 tests for my candidate model, and 1 each for voters and votes. Due to lack of experience with validations and associations, this has become an issue and I'm pretty sure that my final submission may come up short in this area. Will return to testing later."
